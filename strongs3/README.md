Strong's Bible Dictionary
=========================

Python 3 tool for Strong's Bible dictionary data. Contains both Greek New Testament dictionary and Hebrew Old Testament dictionary.

This is based on my previous [Strong's New Testament Dictionary](https://github.com/markomanninen/strongs) library for Python 2. Changes are 

1. support for Python 3
2. isopsephy package is replaced by newer Abnum library

For usage see examples on Jupyter notebook:
